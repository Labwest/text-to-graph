# text-to-graph

WIP 

It shows on the screen the plots data row, simply reading it from the text file. Just pass as input of the function the array of filepath where are saved the data to be graphed. 

## Graph types

Three types of charts available.
- `dot`
- `bar`
- `line`

Uses one of these as an input property, after the list of text files to read.  


### Test 

It exists a `test.py` scipt to show how it works. 

- `python3 test.py`
